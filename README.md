# kcPm: Kicad Part Manager

This is a Kicad Part Manager based on mysql connector writed in Python Qt4. It is based on the Kicad Part Manager wrote by Mike Crash: http://mikecrash.com/index.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=10 using WxWidgets. I ported the program to Qt4 because I wanted to learn Qt Programming and I needed a Part Manager to manage my lab prototypes.

Although it is under development, you can manage parts, categories, purchases, storage places, suppliers, etc.. and it even could make a full backup of the Database. In the future, you would be able to manage Kicad BOM and ease prototype manufacturing.

In contrib folder you can find the configuration files to convert to exe under windows. NSIS configuration file and py2exe configuration file.
