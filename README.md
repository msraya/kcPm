Kicad Part Manager
This is a Kicad Part Manager based on mysql connector write in Python Qt4. It is based on the Kicad Part Manager wrote by Mike Crash: http://mikecrash.com/index.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=10 using wxwidgets. I port to Qt4 because I want to learn Qt Programming and I need a Part Manager to manage my lab prototypes.

Although it is work in progress, you can manage parts, categories, purchases, storage places, suppliers, etc.. and also make a full backup of the Database.

In contrib you can find the configuration files to convert to exe under windows. NSIS configuration file and py2exe configuration file.
